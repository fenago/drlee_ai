## Curriculum Design Notes

### Practical Focus: Building Real React Applications

**Core Approach:**
- **Build Multiple React Apps:** Each module includes building complete React applications using sub-agents
- **Context Engineering Mastery:** Deep focus on how to structure context for optimal sub-agent performance
- **Context Stuffing Techniques:** Learn how to load sub-agents with exactly the right context for each task
- **MCP Server Integration:** Connect to real tools and databases using Model Context Protocol
- **Real Use Cases:** E-commerce platforms, dashboards, SaaS products, internal tools

**Example Projects Built Throughout Course:**
1. **Module 2-3:** E-commerce product catalog with AI-powered search (sub-agents for data fetching, UI generation, testing)
2. **Module 4-5:** Analytics dashboard with real-time data (context engineering for data visualization agents)
3. **Module 6-7:** Multi-tenant SaaS application (plugin architecture with specialized sub-agents)
4. **Module 8-9:** Production deployment pipeline (CI/CD automation with headless sub-agents)

**Context Engineering Principles:**
- How to structure project context for sub-agent understanding
- Techniques for context stuffing: what to include, what to exclude
- Context window optimization strategies
- Memory persistence patterns for multi-session projects

**MCP Server Use Cases:**
- Database connections (PostgreSQL, MongoDB via MCP)
- API integrations (Stripe, Twilio, SendGrid)
- Development tools (GitHub, Vercel, Linear)
- Data sources (Notion, Airtable, Google Sheets)

### Shu-Ha-Ri Applied to Each Module:
- **Shu (Learn):** TedTalk-style conceptual introduction, executive overview
- **Ha (Practice):** Hands-on building React apps with sub-agents and MCP servers
- **Ri (Transcend):** Innovation, mastery, creating your own methods

### Competitive Moat Building:
Each module explicitly shows how the skills build:
1. **Technical Moat:** Deep understanding of context engineering that competitors can't replicate
2. **Efficiency Moat:** Sub-agent systems that create 10-100x productivity advantages
3. **Infrastructure Moat:** MCP integrations and plugins that compound over time
4. **Knowledge Moat:** Insights from building real applications, not consuming tutorials

### Differentiation from Other Courses:
- **Not a tutorial course:** Building real React apps with production-grade sub-agents, not toy examples
