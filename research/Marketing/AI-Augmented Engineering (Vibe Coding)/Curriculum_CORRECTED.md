**Shu-Ha-Ri Flow:**
Each module naturally progresses:
- **Lessons 1-3:** Conceptual understanding (Shu - "What is this? Why does it matter?")
- **Lessons 4-7:** Hands-on building (Ha - "Build it yourself with guidance")
- **Lessons 8-10:** Advanced patterns and mastery (Ri - "Innovate and optimize for your needs")

**Practical & Applied:**
Every module builds something real, progressively growing from simple to-do app to complete production AI-augmented infrastructure.
