## SUMMARY

The Profit Pyramid reveals that **"Build Your Own Domain Specific LLMs"** serves two distinct customer bases across four maturity levels:

**For Engineers:** The journey from commodity API integrator ($100K-$150K) → irreplaceable SLM architect ($300K-$600K+) → elite thought leader and consultant.

**For Founders:** The transformation from cash-burning API wrapper ($0-$50K MRR) → defensible SLM-powered business ($1M+ MRR) → category-leading AI platform.

Each level has different primary currencies, pain points, and price sensitivity. The key is to:
1. **Meet them where they are** with appropriate messaging and pricing
2. **Show clear path upward** to next level's outcomes
3. **Create natural ascension** through Product Ladder offerings
4. **Maximize lifetime value** by serving customers across their entire journey

The ultimate goal: Help the 1% who BUILD domain-specific AI dominate their markets while the 99% who CONSUME APIs get commoditized.
