## THE PRODUCT LADDER PHILOSOPHY

The Product Ladder is an ascension model that offers customers a clear pathway to receive more value at higher prices. Each rung of the ladder provides increasing value, intimacy, and results. The goal is to segment the sales funnel into "baby steps" that customers can advance through with minimal resistance.

**Key Principles:**
- **Start Free:** Low-friction entry to build trust and demonstrate value
- **Quick Wins:** Early products deliver immediate results, establishing credibility
- **Progressive Intimacy:** Move from automated to personalized to high-touch
- **Value Scaling:** Each tier delivers exponentially more value than price increase
