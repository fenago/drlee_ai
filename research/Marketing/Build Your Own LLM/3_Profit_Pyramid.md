# Profit Pyramid - Build Your Own LLM

**Course:** Build Your Own Large Language Model
**Framework:** Profit Pyramid
**Purpose:** Customer Segmentation & Targeted Messaging

---

## The Profit Pyramid Structure

The Profit Pyramid segments customers into 4 levels based on their current situation, allowing for targeted messaging, pricing, and product offerings. Each level has distinct symptoms (pain points) and keys to success (what they need to advance).

**The 4 Levels:**
1. **Struggling** - Starting point, maximum pain
2. **Surviving** - Getting by, but not thriving
3. **Thriving** - Doing well, ready to scale
4. **Driving** - Elite level, leading the field
