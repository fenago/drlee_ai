- "VCs want to see proprietary technology, not API wrappers"
- "I'm spending $30K/month on o1 API—I need to own these weights"
- "If we can train our own reasoning model, we have a real moat"

### 2. PROBLEM (Biggest Frustrations)

**Primary Frustrations:**

#### Financial Burn
- API costs of $5,000-$50,000/month ($60K-$600K annually)
- Costs scaling linearly with usage (unit economics getting worse)
- Gross margins stuck at 50-70% (VCs demand 80%+)
- Can't offer unlimited plans due to unpredictable API costs
- One API price increase could tank profitability

#### Zero Differentiation
- Product is just wrapper around o1/o3 API
- Competitors can replicate features by calling same APIs
- No proprietary reasoning capabilities
- Product roadmap limited by what OpenAI releases
- Can't explain to investors why product is defensible

#### Fundraising Challenges
- Investors skeptical of "thin wrapper" businesses
- Viewed as "feature not company" by VCs
- Can't command premium valuation without proprietary tech
- Difficulty raising Series A without technical moat
- Competitors with owned models getting funded at higher valuations

#### Vendor Lock-In
- Completely dependent on OpenAI/Anthropic availability
- API downtime = entire business down
- No control over reasoning quality or capabilities
- Can't customize reasoning for domain-specific problems
- Forced to accept whatever pricing/terms vendors dictate

#### Enterprise Sales Blocked
- Enterprise customers demand data sovereignty
- Can't guarantee privacy (data goes through third-party APIs)
- Can't offer on-premise deployment
- Compliance issues with sending sensitive data to external APIs
- Losing deals to competitors with owned models

**What They Say:**
- "We're burning $40K/month on o1 API and margins are terrible"
- "Investors keep asking 'what's your moat?' and I don't have a good answer"
- "Our competitor raised Series A at 2x our valuation because they own their reasoning models"
- "We lost a $500K enterprise deal because we couldn't deploy on-premise"
- "If OpenAI raises prices 20%, we're unprofitable"
- "I can't scale the business when API costs scale linearly with revenue"

### 3. PROFIT (Currency Metric)

**Primary Currency:** COST SAVINGS & COMPANY VALUATION

**Current State:**
- $60,000 - $600,000 annual API costs
- $0 - $2M annual recurring revenue
- 50-70% gross margins (too low for SaaS)
- Seed/Series A valuation: $5M - $20M
- "API wrapper" positioning hurts valuation

**Desired State:**
- $0 API costs (100% owned reasoning models)
- $2M - $10M+ annual recurring revenue
- 80-95% gross margins (best-in-class for AI SaaS)

- "Should I hire an ML engineer instead?"
- "Is this production-ready or just academic?"
- "What if I can't get it working?"
- "Will this distract from product-market fit?"

**Decision Timeline:**
- Awareness → Decision: 1-4 weeks (faster than Career Advancers)
- More decisive, less research paralysis
- Willing to invest more for faster time-to-value
- Prefers Founder's Edition or Done With You for implementation support
- Will pay premium for 1-on-1 guidance and guaranteed results

**Post-Purchase Behavior:**
- Highly focused on implementation speed
- Leverages support heavily (office hours, 1-on-1 calls)
- Likely to upgrade to Done With You if needs hands-on help
- Shares success story publicly if achieves API elimination
- Becomes case study and referral source
- May pursue equity partnership if building category-defining company
