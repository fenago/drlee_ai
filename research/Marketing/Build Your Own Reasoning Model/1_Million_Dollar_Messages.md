## SECONDARY MESSAGE (FOUNDERS/ENTREPRENEURS)

### Who: Technical Founders & CTOs

**"I help technical founders and CTOs build proprietary reasoning models that create defensible competitive moats—like o1 but owned and customized—so they can eliminate $100K-$500K in annual API costs and own reasoning capabilities without being held hostage by OpenAI rate limits, building 'thin wrapper' businesses that VCs won't fund, or spending $300K-$500K hiring ML engineers who may not understand reasoning systems."**

### Key Components:

**1. Biggest Goal/Desire:**
- Own proprietary reasoning technology
- Create defensible competitive advantage
- Eliminate massive reasoning API costs ($10K-$50K/month)

## MESSAGE VARIATIONS BY USE CASE

### For Backend Engineers
**"I help backend engineers become reasoning AI infrastructure specialists by teaching them to build o1-style systems from scratch, so they can command $300K+ salaries and lead reasoning platform teams without relying on third-party APIs or being limited to prompt engineering."**

### For Data Scientists
**"I help data scientists transition from statistical modeling to reasoning system architecture by building process-supervised reward models from first principles, so they can become reasoning AI engineers earning $250K-$350K without being stuck in analysis or dependent on pre-trained reasoning APIs."**

### For ML Engineers (Junior/Mid)
**"I help junior and mid-level ML engineers master process-supervised RL and inference-time scaling by coding reasoning systems from scratch, so they can reach staff/principal level ($350K-$450K) and architect o1-class AI without relying on black-box APIs or being limited to fine-tuning."**

### For Startup CTOs
**"I help startup CTOs build proprietary reasoning models that become their technical moat, so they can raise Series A based on differentiated AI and save $200K-$500K annually on reasoning API costs without betting their business on OpenAI's pricing and availability."**

### For Enterprise Architects
**"I help enterprise architects build on-premise reasoning models that meet compliance requirements, so they can deploy secure AI systems with advanced problem-solving and reduce reasoning API costs by 80%+ without sacrificing quality or depending on external vendors."**

## SUPPORTING MESSAGING ELEMENTS

### Metric & Timeline
- **9 weeks** to production reasoning model (self-paced)
- **12 weeks** with live cohort support
- **5 days** intensive bootcamp format
- From zero to deployed reasoning model in **60-90 days**
- Save **$10K-$50K/month** in reasoning API costs
- ROI achieved in **2-4 months**

### The Big WHY
**Stop renting reasoning. Start owning it.**

You're not learning to use reasoning AI—you're learning to build it. This isn't about calling o1 APIs or writing clever prompts. This is about understanding process-supervised reward modeling, chain-of-thought training, inference-time scaling, and reinforcement learning at a level where you can architect, train, and deploy your own reasoning systems.

**Why this matters:**
- Reasoning API access is rented capability—you own nothing
- Owned reasoning models are your competitive moat
- Deep reasoning knowledge = irreplaceability = premium compensation
- Proprietary reasoning systems = defensible business advantage
- Reasoning is the next frontier—be there first

### Specificity & Relevance

**For Engineers:**
- Not another tutorial on using o1—build the actual reasoning system
- Code every component: PSRM training → CoT supervision → inference scaling
- PyTorch from scratch, no black boxes
- Production-grade techniques: process rewards, outcome rewards, RL training
- Understand exactly how o1/o3/DeepSeek-R1 work internally

**For Founders:**
- Real cost savings: $120K-$600K annually in reasoning API elimination
- Actual moat: own reasoning weights = differentiated product
- Fundraising advantage: proprietary reasoning raises at higher valuations
- Technical sovereignty: no vendor can shut you down or change pricing
- Domain customization: train reasoning for your specific problems

### Complimentary Language

**You're already...**
- A skilled engineer (not starting from zero)
- Familiar with transformers and LLMs
- Ready for frontier reasoning AI (not beginner content)
- Thinking strategically about your career/business
- Curious about how o1 and o3 actually work

**This course is for...**
- Engineers who refuse to stay at the API layer
- Founders who want technological sovereignty over reasoning
- Leaders who see reasoning as infrastructure, not magic
- Builders who want to own their reasoning systems
- The 1% who want to BUILD reasoning AI like o1, not consume it

## POSITIONING STATEMENTS

### Against Competitors

**vs. Using o1/Claude/Gemini APIs Forever:**
"Reasoning APIs are rented capability. Reasoning model weights are owned assets. One is an operating expense that compounds forever. The other is a one-time learning investment that pays dividends for life."

**vs. Hugging Face Tutorials (Free):**
"Hugging Face teaches you to use pre-trained reasoning models. We teach you to build reasoning systems like o1 from scratch. There's a difference between being a model consumer and a reasoning architect."

**vs. Fast.ai / Coursera ($0-$50):**
"Online courses teach theory and toy examples. We teach production implementation of reasoning systems. You'll build and deploy real PSRM-trained models, not complete multiple-choice quizzes."

**vs. University ML/RL Courses ($5K-$20K):**
"Academic programs focus on RL theory and proofs. We focus on reasoning implementation and deployment. You'll have a working reasoning model before university students finish their problem sets."

**vs. Hiring ML Engineers ($300K-$500K/year):**
"One ML engineer with reasoning expertise costs $300K-$500K and might not deliver. This course costs $1,997-$19,997 and guarantees you'll build a reasoning system in 12 weeks. The ROI is obvious."

**vs. Building with Reasoning APIs Forever:**
"Every reasoning API call costs money and gives you zero differentiation. Own your reasoning models once, use them forever, and build moats competitors can't replicate."

## CALL-TO-ACTION LANGUAGE

### For Webinars
**"Stop renting reasoning from OpenAI. Learn to build o1-style reasoning models from scratch—and own your reasoning capabilities for life."**

### For Landing Pages
**"The only course that teaches you to code process-supervised reward models, train chain-of-thought reasoning, and deploy o1-class systems with zero API dependency."**

### For Email Sequences
**"What if you could build your own o1? Not call the API. Not prompt it better. Actually build the reasoning system with PSRM training, CoT supervision, and inference-time scaling. That's this course."**

### For Sales Pages
**"Join 300+ engineers who've gone from API users to reasoning architects—commanding $250K-$400K salaries and building reasoning products that can't be replicated by every competitor with an o1 account."**

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Isn't this too advanced for me?"
**Response:** If you understand transformers and basic RL concepts, you're ready. We build from first principles, starting with reward modeling and working up to full reasoning systems. Every concept is explained and coded step-by-step.

### "Can't I just use the o1 API?"
**Response:** You can—if you're okay with $50K/year in reasoning costs, zero differentiation, vendor lock-in, and being viewed as an API consumer instead of a reasoning architect. APIs are for prototypes. Model ownership is for production and moats.

### "Won't this take forever to learn?"
**Response:** 9 weeks self-paced, 12 weeks with cohort, or 5 days intensive bootcamp. Faster than a university course, deeper than YouTube tutorials, and you'll have a deployed reasoning model at the end—not just certificates.

### "What if I don't understand RL deeply?"
**Response:** You don't need a PhD in RL. You need to understand reward modeling and policy gradient basics. We teach process-supervised RL specifically for reasoning—a focused, practical approach, not academic theory.

### "Isn't reasoning too complex?"
**Response:** DeepSeek-R1 proved reasoning models can be built openly. We teach the exact techniques: process rewards, chain-of-thought supervision, inference scaling. If DeepSeek can do it, so can you with proper guidance.

### "Isn't it too expensive?"
**Response:** Compared to what? Hiring one reasoning AI engineer costs $300K-$500K. University RL programs cost $50K-$100K. Paying o1 API costs $120K-$600K annually forever. This course is $1,997-$19,997 one time. The ROI is immediate.
