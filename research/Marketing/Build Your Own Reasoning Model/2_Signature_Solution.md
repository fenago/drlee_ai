## THE DRLEE.AI SHU-HA-RI LEARNING METHOD

This masterclass follows the ancient Japanese martial arts philosophy of **Shu-Ha-Ri**, adapted for elite technical education:

### **Shu (守 - Protect)** - Learn with Your Hands
Each module begins with a **TedTalk-style masterclass** where complex reasoning AI concepts are explained with clarity and inspiration. Then you immediately **build it yourself**—hands-on coding, real implementations, zero abstraction.

### **Ha (破 - Break)** - Build and Apply
You don't just replicate examples. You modify reward models, experiment with inference budgets, and adapt reasoning techniques to your specific problems. This is where passive learning transforms into active mastery.

### **Ri (離 - Transcend)** - Own and Innovate
By the end, you don't just know how reasoning models work—you can architect novel reasoning systems, make strategic build-vs-buy decisions, and lead frontier reasoning AI initiatives. You transcend the teachings and create your own path.

**This is executive business education (Harvard/MIT/Stanford caliber) merged with a masterclass for tech founders and AI leaders.**

Every section follows this pattern:
1. **Inspire** - TedTalk-style presentation of the reasoning concept
2. **Implement** - Build it yourself with guided hands-on coding
3. **Integrate** - Apply to your specific context and use case
4. **Innovate** - Leave with the foundation to go beyond what was taught

**IMPORTANT:** Unlike traditional progressive learning, **each module is a complete Shu-Ha-Ri cycle**. Module 3 doesn't require Module 2 to follow Shu-Ha-Ri—every module independently takes you through Learn → Break → Transcend.
