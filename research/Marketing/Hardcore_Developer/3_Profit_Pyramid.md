## Detailed Level Breakdown

### LEVEL 1: STRUGGLING 😰
**Currency:** $100K-$150K Salary / $0-$100K Revenue
**Status:** "No Leads" → API-Dependent Builder

#### SYMPTOMS (What They're Experiencing)

**For Career Advancers:**
- 💸 **Salary Plateau:** Stuck at $100K-$150K despite years of experience
- 🔗 **API Dependency:** Building ChatGPT wrappers, not real AI systems
- 😰 **Imposter Syndrome:** Feel like a "prompt engineer," not a real AI engineer
- 📉 **Career Anxiety:** Worried about being replaced by no-code tools
- 🚫 **No Differentiation:** Same skills as thousands of other "AI engineers"
- ⚠️ **Vendor Risk:** Terrified OpenAI will change pricing or kill their project
- 🎯 **Frustrated:** Know they're capable of more but don't know how to break through

**For Founders:**
- 💰 **High API Costs:** Spending $1K-$10K/month on OpenAI with no control
