## Supporting Messages

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"We teach business leaders to build their own AI workforce—synthetic employees that provide expert decision support in legal, finance, and operations. Instead of renting generic AI or hiring expensive consultants, you'll own custom intelligence that knows YOUR business, connects to YOUR systems, and saves $200K-$500K annually. It's like having a team of analysts working 24/7, but you built them yourself."

### One-Sentence Hook
"Stop renting AI from OpenAI—build your own synthetic employees that actually understand your business."

### Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS)

**Problem**:
You're making million-dollar decisions but waiting days for analysis from overworked teams or expensive consultants who don't truly understand your business.

**Agitate**:
Meanwhile, your competition is moving faster. ChatGPT can't help because you can't risk sharing confidential data. Hiring more analysts costs $200K+ each. Every delayed decision costs revenue. Every consultant project adds dependency.

**Solution**:
Build your own AI workforce—synthetic employees that know YOUR business inside-out, connect to YOUR systems, work 24/7, and cost pennies compared to human analysts. Own the technology. Control your data. Move at AI speed.

### Before-After-Bridge (BAB)

**Before**:
- Waiting 3-5 days for financial analysis on urgent deals
- Paying consultants $15K-$50K for generic recommendations
- Can't use AI tools because of data privacy concerns
- Critical decisions made with incomplete information
- Limited by headcount budget for analyst team

**After**:
- Getting comprehensive analysis in 5-10 minutes
- Running unlimited analyses for cost of compute (~$20/month)
- AI that works with your most sensitive data, on your infrastructure
- Every decision backed by thorough multi-perspective analysis
- Infinite scale without hiring, licensing, or dependencies

**Bridge**:
"Build Your Own Synthetic Employees" teaches you to create AI decision support systems using the Claude Agent SDK—no deep coding required. In 9 weeks (or 5 intensive days), you'll build from a simple advisor to a complete AI workforce that transforms how your business makes decisions.

## Objection Handling

### "I'm not technical enough"
**Response**: This course is specifically designed for business leaders, not developers. We provide code templates for every exercise—you'll customize them for your business without writing code from scratch. If you can use Excel, you can build synthetic employees.

### "We already use ChatGPT/Claude"
**Response**: That's renting generic AI that forgets context and can't access your systems. You're building OWNED intelligence that remembers everything, connects to your CRM/ERP, and gets smarter with every interaction. It's the difference between renting office space and owning real estate.

### "Sounds expensive to build and maintain"
**Response**: Course is $997-$9,997 one-time. After that, you're paying only API costs (~$20-$200/month depending on usage). Compare to $30-$50/user/month for ChatGPT Teams, $5K-$50K per consultant project, or $600K-$1.5M for a data science team. Your ROI is 48x-120x in year one.

### "How long until we see results?"
**Response**: You'll build your first functional synthetic employee in Module 1 (Week 1 or Day 1). By Module 3, it'll be producing structured data for your systems. Most students report ROI within 60 days of course completion—often from the first production deployment.

### "What if it doesn't work for our industry?"
**Response**: The SDK works for ANY industry—we have examples from legal, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, real estate, and more. The framework is domain-agnostic; you'll customize it with YOUR industry knowledge, making it more powerful than any pre-built solution.
