## FAQS FOR PRICING PAGE

**Q: Why is DrLee.ai more expensive than Udemy or Coursera?**
A: We're not competing with Udemy. We're the only platform teaching you to BUILD frontier AI systems from scratch with live expert instruction. Compare us to hiring ML engineers ($200K+/year) or traditional bootcamps ($11K-$17K), and we're the best value in the market.

**Q: What's the difference between Self-Paced, Cohort, and Founder's Edition?**
A: Self-Paced is video content at your own pace. Cohort adds live weekly sessions, community, and group mentorship. Founder's Edition includes 1:1 strategic consulting and custom project reviews—designed for funded founders building companies.

**Q: Can I upgrade from Self-Paced to Cohort later?**
A: Yes! You can apply your Self-Paced purchase as a credit toward a Cohort enrollment within 90 days.

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?**
A: Yes. We offer 2-pay, 3-pay, and 6-pay plans with 0% interest on most courses.

**Q: What if I'm not satisfied?**
A: 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. We're confident in the value we provide.

**Q: Is this worth it for someone early in their career?**
A: If you're serious about becoming an elite AI engineer, absolutely. Our graduates land $250K+ roles. The ROI is 40x-100x in your first year alone.

**Q: How is this different from Sebastian Raschka's book?**
A: Sebastian's book is excellent—it's passive learning. DrLee.ai adds live instruction, expert mentorship, community support, and a complete curriculum across multiple frontier AI topics. It's the difference between reading a book and attending graduate school.
