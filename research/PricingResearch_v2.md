# DrLee.ai Masterclass Pricing Strategy v2
## Focused Catalog: 21 Courses, 2 Categories

---

## Executive Summary

This streamlined pricing strategy focuses exclusively on **builders**—people who want to create AI systems, not just consume content about AI. By eliminating Career & Leadership courses and consolidating categories, we sharpen our positioning:

> **"Stop Consuming. Start Building."**

| Category | Courses | Target | Investment Range |
|----------|---------|--------|------------------|
| **Hardcore Developers** | 14 | Engineers & Technical Founders | $497 - $7,997 |
| **Citizen Developer** | 7 | Non-Technical Builders & Operators | $397 - $7,997 |

**Key Insight**: Every course now answers one question: "What can I BUILD after completing this?"

---

## The Focused Value Proposition

### What We Removed and Why

| Removed Category | Courses | Reason |
|------------------|---------|--------|
| Career & Leadership | 6 | Diluted "builder" identity; commoditized content space |

Career transition, interview prep, and leadership skills are widely available. Our moat is **teaching people to build AI from scratch**. This focus creates:

1. **Clearer positioning**: "DrLee.ai = Build AI from First Principles"
2. **Higher perceived value**: Every course produces tangible output
3. **Better student outcomes**: Portfolios, not just certificates
4. **Stronger word-of-mouth**: "I built my own LLM" vs "I learned about interviews"

### What We Consolidated

| Original Categories | Now | Rationale |
|---------------------|-----|-----------|
| Vibe Marketing (1) | Citizen Developer | Marketing automation = building with AI |
| Higher Education (1) | Citizen Developer | Institutional transformation = building systems |

This creates a clean binary:
- **Hardcore Developers**: Write code, train models, deploy systems
- **Citizen Developers**: Build automations, workflows, and AI-powered operations (low/no-code)
