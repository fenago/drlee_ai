# DrLee.ai Masterclass Pricing Strategy - REVISED 2025
## Market-Validated Pricing: 21 Courses, 2 Categories

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding**: DrLee.ai is significantly underpriced relative to market value and competitive landscape.

After comprehensive market research (November 2025), we've identified a massive pricing gap. Competitors charge:
- **Traditional AI Bootcamps** (teaching API usage): $11,000-$17,980
- **University AI Programs** (non-technical): $22,000-$40,000
- **Executive Education** (strategy only): $15,000-$89,000
- **Sebastian Raschka** (closest "build from scratch" content): $80 for passive video

**DrLee.ai's Unique Position**: The ONLY platform teaching founders and engineers to build frontier AI systems from first principles with live instruction and community support.

**Revised Pricing Philosophy**: Price based on VALUE CREATED, not competitor pricing.

| Category | Courses | Target | New Investment Range |
|----------|---------|--------|---------------------|
| **Hardcore Developers** | 14 | Engineers & Technical Founders | $697 - $19,997 |
| **Citizen Developer** | 7 | Non-Technical Builders & Operators | $497 - $7,997 |

## Market Research Summary (November 2025)

### Competitive Landscape Analysis

| Segment | Provider | What They Teach | Price | Gap vs DrLee.ai |
|---------|----------|----------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Books/Self-Study** | Sebastian Raschka | Build LLM (book + video) | $24-$80 | No live instruction, no community |
| **MOOC Platforms** | DeepLearning.ai (Andrew Ng) | Using ML frameworks | $49/month | API tutorials, not from scratch |
| **Free Courses** | Fast.ai (Jeremy Howard) | Practical DL with fastai | FREE | Uses frameworks, not first principles |
| **AI Bootcamps** | General Assembly, Fullstack | Build apps WITH AI | $11,000-$17,980 | Teaches API calls, not AI systems |
| **University Programs** | Virginia Tech, USD, UT Dallas | Applied AI/ML | $10,995 | 26 weeks, app-focused |
| **Premium Cohorts** | Columbia AI Program | AI applications | $3,666/course ($22K total) | Non-technical business focus |
| **Executive Education** | MIT xPRO | AI strategy | $2,500-$4,700/course | Business leaders, non-technical |
| **Top Exec Ed** | Stanford GSB | AI business strategy | $15,000-$89,000 | C-suite, no coding |
| **MasterClass** | Various celebrities | Entertainment/inspiration | $120-$240/year | Not technical education |

### The Critical Gap

**NO ONE teaches "Build Frontier AI from Scratch" at scale with live instruction.**

DrLee.ai is the ONLY platform offering:
- ✅ Build LLMs, reasoning models, diffusion systems FROM SCRATCH
- ✅ First-principles understanding (not API tutorials)
- ✅ Live cohort instruction with expert mentorship
- ✅ Community support and accountability
- ✅ Practical, deployable outcomes

## Pricing Philosophy: The Value Equation

### For Founders (The Build vs Buy Calculation)

| What Founders Currently Pay | Annual Cost | DrLee.ai Alternative |
|------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 ML Engineer (junior) | $200,000 | $6,997-$19,997 (one-time) |
| ML Team (3-5 engineers) | $600K-$1.5M | $24,997 bundle (one-time) |
| AI Development Agency | $50K-$500K per project | Own the capability forever |
| GPT-3 scale training | $4.6M | Learn to build your own |
| OpenAI API (at scale) | $50K-$500K/year | No vendor lock-in |

**ROI for Founders**: 10x-100x in Year 1 alone

### For Career Advancers (The Skill Premium)

| Investment Type | Cost | Outcome |
|----------------|------|---------|
| Traditional Bootcamp | $11,000-$17,000 | Land $120K role (API skills) |
| DrLee.ai Cohort | $4,997-$6,997 | Land $250K+ role (build AI) |
| **Skill Premium** | **40-60% less cost** | **2x higher salary** |

**ROI for Career Advancers**: 40x-100x
