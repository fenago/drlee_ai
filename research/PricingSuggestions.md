# DrLee.ai Masterclass Pricing Strategy
## Complete Catalog: 26 Courses

---

## Executive Summary

This pricing strategy addresses **two distinct buyer personas** with radically different value equations:

| Persona | Value Equation | Willingness to Pay |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Career Advancer** | $2K course → $150-200K job | $500 - $3,000 |
| **Founder/Builder** | $5K course → $50K-$5M saved + defensible moat | $3,000 - $15,000+ |

The "Build from Scratch" courses (LLMs, Reasoning Models, Diffusion, MoE, Agentic Systems) are **exceptionally rare** in the market. There are virtually no comprehensive courses teaching founders to build competitive AI technology from first principles. This creates significant pricing power.

## The Founder Value Proposition

### What Founders Currently Pay to Build AI

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Hiring ML Engineers | $150K-$300K/year | Each. Need 3-5 for serious AI work |
| AI Development Agency | $50K-$500K | Per project |
| Custom AI from Scratch | $1M-$5M+ | Full foundation model training |
| Infrastructure | $5K-$10K/month | Per developer working on AI |
| Model Training Compute | $100K-$4.6M | GPT-3 cost ~$4.6M to train |

### What DrLee.ai Offers Instead

A founder who completes "Build Your Own LLM from Scratch" can:
- Build a proprietary language model on a laptop
- Fine-tune and deploy without API dependency
- Create defensible IP that VCs value at 20%+ premium
- Eliminate reliance on OpenAI/Anthropic pricing changes
- Iterate on their own timeline without vendor lock-in

**This knowledge is worth $100K+ to a serious founder** — we're offering it for a fraction of that.

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Offer | Their Price | DrLee.ai Advantage |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Bootcamps | 26-week programs | $10K-$16K | More focused, 1/3 the price |
| Coursera/Udemy | Surface-level content | $50-$200 | Build from scratch, not tutorials |
| Executive Ed (MIT/Stanford) | Business-focused | $15K-$25K | Technical depth + practical |
| Sebastian Raschka Book | LLM from scratch (book) | $50 | Live instruction, community, support |
| Free YouTube | Scattered, incomplete | Free | Structured, comprehensive, accountable |

**DrLee.ai fills the gap**: Too technical for executive programs, too comprehensive for Udemy, more affordable than bootcamps, more structured than free content.

## Summary: The Two Audiences, Two Value Props

|-|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Pain** | Stuck in career, can't break into AI | Can't afford AI team, dependent on APIs |
